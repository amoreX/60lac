## üóëÔ∏è How to Remove Student Loan After Testing

### Step 1: Remove from Loan Configuration
**File:** `src/config/loanConfig.ts`

**Remove lines 162-190:**
```typescript
// ========== TESTING ONLY - REMOVE AFTER TESTING ==========
student_loan: {
  name: "student_loan",
  displayName: "Student Loan",
  requiredDocuments: [
    "Valid ID Proof (Aadhaar/Student ID)",
    "Resume/CV",
    "Academic Transcripts/Grade Reports",
    "College Admission Letter (if applicable)",
    "Parent/Guardian Income Proof (if co-applicant)",
  ],
  requiredFields: [
    "full_name",
    "phone_number",
    "email",
    "college_name",
    "course_name",
    "year_of_study",
    "gpa_cgpa",
    "number_of_hackathons_participated",
    "number_of_projects",
    "technical_skills",
    "internship_experience",
    "github_profile",
    "loan_amount_required",
    "purpose_of_loan",

## üìù Testing Tips

1. **Upload Resume (PDF):** The system will extract name, college, skills, projects, etc.
2. **Upload Transcript (Image):** AI will extract GPA and course details
3. **Send text messages:** Provide hackathon participation, GitHub profile, etc.
4. **Check console:** Once all fields collected, loan submission will be logged

The AI will intelligently extract all information from documents and ask for missing fields one by one!
